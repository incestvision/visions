# Visions

[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/peachy/visions) / [Github](https://github.com/visions-database/visions)

Modding platform for The Coffin of <span style="color:#86d37a;">Andy</span> and <span style="color:#ec83c3;">Leyley</span>.

Visions is split into 2 parts:

**Visions Database** - a database of TCoAaL mods

**Visions CLI** - a package manager for the Visions Database

⚠️ Visions CLI is primarily developed for Linux and assumes you know how to use the command line. If you want a simple GUI mod manager for TCoAaL, I recommend [Burial](https://luka.moe/burial).
